		The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
		The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
		The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
		The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	The output is printed to the terminal and is written to the output.txt file in the analysis folder

	The main.py file contains code that has the below logic for the election_data.csv:
		The total number of votes cast
		A complete list of candidates who received votes
		The percentage of votes each candidate won
		The total number of votes each candidate won
		The winner of the election based on popular vote
	The output is printed to the terminal and is written to the outputPyPoll.txt file in the analysis folder
